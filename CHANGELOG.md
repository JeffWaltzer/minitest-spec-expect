#### version 1.0.0 - *December 28, 2013*
* Simplified initializer for expect object. Make stable.

#### version 0.1.0 - *May 23, 2013*
* Added ability to pass a block to `#expect`. When a block is passed to it, the expect object responds
to `#to_throw`, `#to_raise`, `#to_output`, and `#to_be_silent`. Big thanks to
