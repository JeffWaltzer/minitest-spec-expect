# minitest-spec-expect
...adds the expect syntax for minitest. It was made out of love for Rspec2's expect syntax and
Minitest's lightweight feel.
## Install
In your Gemfile:
```ruby
gem 'minitest-spec-expect'
```
or
`$ gem install minitest-spec-expect`
## Usage
Wrap the object under test in an `expect()` object. Then call a minitest expectation on it,
substituting `must` with `to` and `wont` with `to_not`.
